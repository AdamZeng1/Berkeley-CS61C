# Project 4 - Performance Programming
Starter code for Summer 2019 Project 4

In this project, I applied some of the performance optimization techniques that I have learned in class to the real-world problem of classifying images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Objectives
  1. The student will use the performance programming techniques learned in class to speed up image recognition tasks.
  2. The student will be able to apply Amdahlâ€™s law to see where to focus most of their efforts.
  3. The student will focus on major speed improvements first before attempting microoptimizations.
