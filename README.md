Repository for Computer Architecture Class at UC Berkeley.

Course Description: https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS61C/

The goal was to learn the great ideas of computer design and implementation (using C and RISC-V Assembly Language):

  1. Memory Hierarchy (e.g., Caches)
  2. Thread Level Parallelism (e.g., Multicore)
  3. Data Level Parallelism (e.g., MapReduce and Graphical Processing Units or GPUs)
  4. Instruction Level Parallelism (e.g., Pipelining)
  5. The Transistor and its rate of change (e.g., Moore's Law)
  6. Quantitative Evaluation (e.g., GFLOPS, Clocks Per Instruction or CPI)
  7. Layering of Hardware Levels of Abstraction (e.g., AND gates, Arithmetic Logic Unit or ALU, Central Processing Units or CPU)
  8. Compilation vs. Interpretation (e.g., C compiler, Java interpreter)
  9. Hardware Instruction Set Interpretation (e.g., instructions as binary numbers)
